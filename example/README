This is a small example to demonstrate reaXtract. The connectivity file was
created by simulating 5 short PEEK molecules with reaxFF for a temperature of
2000K with LAMMPS. Screenshot and data file can be found in the examples folder.

The input file "bonds.reaxff.dump" for reaXtract was created with
fix reaxff/bonds in LAMMPS. After the header the file contains a list with
- id = atom id
- type = atom type
- nb = number of bonds
- id_1 = atom id of first bond
- id_nb = atom id of Nth bond
- mol = molecule id
- bo_1 = bond order of first bond
- bo_nb = bond order of Nth bond
- abo = atom bond order (sum of all bonds)
- nlp = number of lone pairs
- q = atomic charge

To run, simply call reaXtract with the file as single argument:
"reaXtract.py bonds.reaxff.dump"
or
"python3 reaXtract.py bonds.reaxff.dump"
